Really good starts on these!  For each question, see if you can dig into a more complete physical explanation during class today.  Why is the high flow so close to the inclusion?  Why are the flow plots symmetric?  Why does high or low K have a bigger impact?  Why might the relative, not the absolute, K difference dictate the head distribution.  You are perfectly primed to have some great insights!!
