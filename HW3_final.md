Nice work on this - 95%.  You are really making progress on connecting the model results to hydrologic ideas!  Next week, I'd like you to try something.  To me, your answers read like you are speaking to me and hoping that you have the right answer.  Next week, write the answer for someone who knows much less than you do about hydrology.  Really explain what is going on.  I think it will help!
