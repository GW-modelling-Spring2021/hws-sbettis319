Really good start.

1. K is constant in this case.  Can you use your reasoning to figure out how
the well is leading to the flow distribution on the boundary?

2. I think that you are interpreting this as a head profile instead of a flow
transect??

3. Start by drawing in the capture zone ... I think that this will sharpen your
answer.

4. Explain a bit more why the boundaries would lead to noncircular drawdown.
But, the drawdown SHOULD be circular right near the well.  Why aren't they?

5. Good discussion of the well effect ... use some of this thinking for the
answer to #1!  For the 'flip' - think about how python defines a matrix's rows
and how MODFLOW defines where row '1' is for the domain ....
